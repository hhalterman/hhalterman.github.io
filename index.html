            Want to know all about me? You're in the right spot. I'm Hailey, and I like to design and take photographs. I am creative and ambitious, ready to tackle anything life has to throw at me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My creativity is what drove me to Bowling Green State University, and landed me into their Visual Communication Technology program, where I studied interactive media, photography, print media, and videography. On top of those subjects, I completed three internships and balanced my creative classes with marketing and business courses.

            When I am not at work or school, I can be found adventuring with my camera by my side, since I most enjoy spending my time outdoors and with family. You also might find me hanging out in a hammock, curled up with a book and a coffee, kayaking like its my job, or cliff jumping.
